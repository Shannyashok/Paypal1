Readme.txt
My idea is to develop an e-Commerce platform (Lazada - my previous workplace) with PayPal Express checkout.
I have two tables in database Lazada (Bags and Login details)
And I have 11 jsp file and 8 java files respectively
Which looks like

1. the Initial web page with login and signup and products  
(1 a. Sign In page  b. Sign up Page)

2. Buy now button leads you to the choose payment page
 
3. Proceed to checkout leads you to the payment page

4. The PayPal Checkout Page 
 
5. The Billing Information Page

6. The final success Page
